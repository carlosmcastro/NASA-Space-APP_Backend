For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the designation is normally formed by taking the name or, more commonly, designation of its parent star and adding a lower case letter.

"I understand, I understand, but how are stars named? Where do those fuzzy names come from?" 

You can ask me, and the answer is a little more confusing, it depends on the 'catalog'.

The most common catalogs are:
Histoire Céleste Française,  Bonner Durchmusterung,  Henry Draper Catalogue,  Bright Star Catalogue, and so on.

Some names are determined by the 'Mission' that found the star or that studies its stellar system frequently.
