Astronomers classify stars based on their spectral characteristics, which provide information about the temperature on their surfaces (Effective Temperature).

The method consists of analyzing the light of stars through diffraction grids. Incoming photons are divided into a spectrum of colors. Each of these values shows the presence of a chemical element, the excitation of which occurs at a certain degree of temperature.

Some letters of the alphabet relative to each heat level have been used to make the stellar description: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, in descending order. The stars O would be the hottest, the M the coldest. But there is also a non-formal classification associating colors to these stars. So the stars O are called blue; B, blue-white; A, white; F, yellow-white; G, yellow; K, orange, and M, red stars; although these are not necessarily the visible tones.

The most up-to-date method for classifying stars is called the Morgan-Keenan system. It adds a numerical range -between 0 and 9- between the spectra of each nominal letter. A5 would be 5 tenths between A0 and F0, the same principle of numerical fractionation, which allows for greater accuracy in spectral values.

Astronomers also include in this system the luminosity of stars, expressed by Roman numerals: I, II, III, IV and V. These values indicate the width of the absorption bands of the spectrum, which in turn refers to the size of these stars. Class I are the supergiants; class III, the giants; V are the dwarfs or main sequence stars.

The spectrum of the Sun would be G2V, which would be read as a main sequence yellow star, two tenths of the orange star.
