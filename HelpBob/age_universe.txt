The universe is very old, about 13.7 Gyrs. It doesn't seem much, unless we notice that 1 Gyr is a billion years!

Our sun possesses 4.6 Gyr, 1/3 of the age of the universe, not bad.

The age of the galaxy is 13.51 Gyr, almost as much as the age of the universe.

And that of the earth is 4.5 Gyr, does not seem much compared to the sun, but 100000000 years difference is not a negligible figure.

Although it all depends on the scale and position from where you observe.
