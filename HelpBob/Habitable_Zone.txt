In popular jargon there is a tendency to think that the CHZ indicates the area in which a planet can possess life. This is not exactly the case.

The 'Habitable Zone' is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure.

In other words, if the planet has water, it can be in a liquid state. Fulfilling one of the possible conditions for life. But not by guaranteeing it.

It is a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition.

There are mathematical approximations of the CHZ, but still remain in the theoretical field, since we only have the certainty of the CHZ of our solar system.

Studies continue and we may someday be able to reformulate CHZ, providing a general expression for life in planetary systems. And humanity would make a great leap into interplanetary exploration.
