Exoplanet - Any planet beyond our solar system

But we can ask ourselves, what is a planet?

A planet is an astronomical body that orbits a star (like our Earth around the Sun).  Its massiveness gives it a rounded shape. And it is dominant in its orbit (the planet orbits "only" in its orbit).

I know concepts like "massiveness" can be a little strange. Even for physicists, this is why researching and digging into the essence of the universe is so intriguing.

Never stop asking yourself questions!
